            <p>
                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can make documents easier to read and maintain.
                
                CSS can be used to control the appearance of all aspects of a web page, including the layout, fonts, colors, and images. CSS can also be used to create animations and other effects.
