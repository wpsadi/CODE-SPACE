this classification is done based on how language takes input from the user and perform an action
- Imperative -> Js, python, java, etc - for everything we havee to write the code

                example : if i want to want to print table of 10
                    then i have to write lines to code to print that same thing

- declarative -> SQL - we have to tell the end goal and then the language will do it on its own
                example : if i want to sort data, i can write a single line to do this
                whereas in Imperative type of languages i will have to write the code for bubble sort
