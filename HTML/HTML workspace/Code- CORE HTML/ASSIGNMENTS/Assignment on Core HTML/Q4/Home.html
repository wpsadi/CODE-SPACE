            <h2>Home: About HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the backbone of the World Wide Web. It is a markup language that defines the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses a series of tags and attributes to identify the various parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. These tags and attributes are used to format the content and define its appearance, making it easier to read and navigate.
            </p><br>
            <p>HTML is an essential tool for web developers and designers, as it is the foundation of all web pages. It is a versatile language that can be used to create simple or complex web pages, depending on the needs of the user. With the help of other technologies like CSS and JavaScript, HTML can be used to create dynamic and interactive web pages that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
            </p><br>
            <p>In short, HTML is the language that makes the web possible. Without it, the web as we know it today would not exist.
