        <p>HTML comments are used to add notes or explanations to the HTML code that do not affect the way the web page is displayed in a web browser. HTML comments are denoted by the <!-- and --> tags, and anything between these tags will be ignored by the browser.
        <br><br>
        Comments can be useful for developers to provide explanations or reminders about specific sections of code, or to temporarily remove code without deleting it altogether. Additionally, comments can be used to debug code by isolating sections of code that are causing issues.
        <br><br>
        It is important to note that while comments are not visible to the end user, they can still be seen by anyone who views the HTML source code. Therefore, comments should be used appropriately and not contain any sensitive or private information.
        <br><br>
        Overall, HTML comments are a useful tool for developers to provide context and clarity to their code.</p>
