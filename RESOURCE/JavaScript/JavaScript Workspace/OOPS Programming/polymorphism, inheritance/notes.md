1. Encapsulation: It involves bundling data and related behaviours into objects, and providing methods to interact with the object.


Inheritance: It allows classes to inherit properties and behaviours from other classes, forming a hierarchy of classes. Inherited features can be extended or overridden in derived classes.


Polymorphism: It enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. Polymorphism allows methods to be defined in a general way and overridden in specific classes to provide different implementations.


Abstraction: It focuses on representing essential features of objects while hiding unnecessary details. It allows developers to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a common structure for related classes.
