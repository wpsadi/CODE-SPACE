        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating websites. It is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of tasks, from designing the layout of a website to coding the functionality of its features. Web developers use a variety of programming languages and technologies to create websites that are both visually appealing and functional.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>There are two main types of web development: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development is responsible for the appearance and behavior of a website. It includes tasks such as designing the website's layout, creating its graphics, and coding its user interface. Back-end development is responsible for the functionality of a website. It includes tasks such as coding the website's database, its server-side scripts, and its security features.</p>
