    <p class="min">
        The vmin and vmax units allow you to access the size of the smaller or the larger side of the viewport, according to the following rules:

100vmin = 100vw or 100vh, whichever is smaller
1vmin = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is smaller

100vmax = 100vw or 100vh, whichever is larger
1vmax = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is larger
So, in case of a portrait orientation, 100vmin is equal to 100vw, as the viewport is smaller horizontally than vertically. For the same reason, 100vmax will be equal to 100vh.

Similarly, in case of a landscape orientation, 100vmin is equal to 100vh, as the viewport is smaller vertically than horizontally. And, of course, 100vmax will be equal to 100vw here.
