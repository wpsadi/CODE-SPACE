                I was one of the lucky ones who got to meet Steve Jobs in person. It was in 2010, at a small gathering of tech journalists in Cupertino, California. Jobs was there to talk about the upcoming iPhone 4, and I was eager to hear what he had to say.

                I remember being struck by how frail he looked. He had lost a lot of weight, and his skin was pale and drawn. But even though he was clearly ill, he was still the same Steve Jobs I had seen in interviews and on stage. He was passionate, articulate, and full of vision.
                <br><br>
                We talked for about an hour, and I was able to ask him a few questions about the iPhone 4. He was very generous with his time, and he took the time to explain the new features of the phone in detail. I also asked him about his thoughts on the future of technology, and he gave me some insights that I'll never forget.
